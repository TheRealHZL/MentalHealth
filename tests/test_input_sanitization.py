   - data: URLs blocked

✅ Safe HTML Preservation:
   - Basic formatting tags allowed (<p>, <strong>, <em>, etc.)
   - User content can be formatted safely
   - HTML sanitization is context-aware

✅ Schema Validation:
   - All Pydantic schemas sanitize user input
   - Mood entries sanitized
   - Dream entries sanitized
   - Therapy notes sanitized
   - List fields sanitized element-by-element

✅ Additional Protections:
   - Filename sanitization (prevents path traversal)
   - URL validation (blocks dangerous protocols)
   - XSS detection (identifies suspicious patterns)

Security Posture: EXCELLENT ✅
Risk Level: LOW
Compliance: OWASP Best Practices
